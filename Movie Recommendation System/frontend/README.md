# Movie Recommendation App

This project is a movie recommendation application that utilizes FastAPI for the backend and a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. The application recommends movies based on user input and displays the results in a user-friendly interface.

## Frontend Structure

The frontend consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the frontend application.
- **styles/style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the application, defining the layout and visual appearance.
- **scripts/app.js**: The JavaScript file that handles user interactions and communicates with the backend to fetch movie recommendations.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   Change your directory to the frontend folder:
   ```
   cd movie-recommendation-app/frontend
   ```

3. **Open the HTML File**:
   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the application.

## Usage

- Enter a movie title in the input field and click the "Get Recommendations" button.
- The application will fetch and display a list of recommended movies based on the input title.

## Dependencies

The frontend does not have any specific dependencies beyond standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ensure your browser supports modern JavaScript features for the best experience.
